class Simulator():
    """Main simulator class that simulates incidents and reponses at the fire department.

    Parameters
    ----------
    incidents: pd.DataFrame
        The incident data.
    deployments: pd.DataFrame
        The deployment data.
    stations: pd.DataFrame
        The station information including coordinates and station names.
    resource_allocation: pd.DataFrame
        The allocation of vehicles and crews to stations. Expected columns:
        ["kazerne", "TS", "RV", "HV", "WO", "TS_crew_ft", "TS_crew_pt", "RVHV_crew_ft",
        "RVHV_crew_pt", "WO_crew_ft", "WO_crew_pt"].
    load_response_data: boolean, optional
        Whether to load preprocessed response data from disk (True) or to
        calculate it using OSRM.
    load_time_matrix: boolean, optional
        Whether to load the matrix of travel durations from disk (True) or
        to calculate it using OSRM.
    save_response_data: boolean, optional
        Whether to save the prepared response data with OSRM estimates to disk.
    save_time_matrix: boolean, optional
        Whether to save the matrix of travel durations to disk.
    vehicle_types: array-like of strings, optional
        The vehicle types to incorporate in the simulation. Optional, defaults
        to ["TS", "RV", "HV", "WO"].
    location_coords: dict, optional
        The coordinates of all relevant locations like {'loc' -> (lon, lat)}.
        The keys (locations) must be strings.
    predictor: str, optional
        Type of predictor to use. Defaults to 'prophet', which uses Facebook's
        Prophet package to forecast incident rate per incident type based on trend
        and yearly, weekly, and daily patterns.
    max_target: int, optional, default: 18
        The maximum response time target in minutes. This is used as the target
        for priority 1 incidents that do not have a more strict norm (i.e., fires).
    start_time: Timestamp or str (convertible to timestamp), optional
        The start of the time period to simulate. If None, forecasts from
        the end of the data. Defaults to None.
    end_time: Timestamp or str (convertible to timestamp), optional
        The end of the time period to simulate. If None, forecasts until one year
        after the end of the data. Defaults to None.
    data_dir: str, optional
        The path to the directory where data should be loaded from and saved to.
        Defaults to '/data/'.
    osrm_host: str, optional
        URL to the OSRM API, defaults to 'http://localhost:5000'
    location_col: str, optional
        The name of the column that identifies the demand locations, defaults to
        'hub_vak_bk'. This is also the only currently supported value.
    verbose: boolean, optional
        Whether to print progress updates to the console during computations.

    Examples
    --------
    The :code:`Simulator` class takes four datasets as inputs. One with historic incidents,
    one with historic deployments, one with station locations, and one with the resources
    available at each station. After providing this information, a simulation is performed
    in just a single line of code.

    .. code::

        >>> from fdsim.simulation import Simulator
        >>> sim = Simulator(incidents, deployments, stations, resource_allocation)
        >>> sim.simulate_n_incidents(10000)
        >>> # save the simulated incidents and deployments
        >>> sim.save_log("simulation_results.csv")

    .. code:: 

        >>> # Continue simulating where you left of:
        >>> sim.simulate_n_incidents(10000, restart=False)

    You can save the simulor object after initializing, so that next time you can
    skip the initialization.

    .. code::
        
        >>> sim.save_simulator_object()
        >>> from fdsim.helpers import quick_load_simulator
        >>> sim = quick_load_simulator('simulator.pickle')
