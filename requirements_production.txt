# The intended use for this file is to act as a Python requirements file when deploying this simulator on a server.
# It is tested and functioning well on a default Python3 virtual environment running Ubuntu 18.04.01 LTS.
#
# Please not that this requirements file was manually generated by scanning imports in source files.
#
# Possible issues:
# - the wheel package is an extra that was needed on the server;
# - no version numbers are given, a future module/package update might break stuff;
# - GDAL needed to be installed as a base system package as well, the version of this package needs to be the same as pygdal
